HOLLIS GeoSearch Solr Prep
==========================

About
-----
This is a simple script to merge JSON records fetched from the DPLA API (http://dp.la/dev/wiki/Version_0.03_API_Documentation) with their corresponding records output from Metacarta's GeoTagger, and then spit out the merged document as XML ready to be imported into Solr.
